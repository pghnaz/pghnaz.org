title: Privacy Policy
---

This policy applies to all information collected through https://pghnaz.org/ and any of its subdomains.

## What information do we collect?

We do not collect any personal information other than what you explicity share with us through our sites.

For example, on [our main contact form](/contact/) (https://pghnaz.org/contact/), we ask for two pieces of personal information. First, we ask for your first and last name (how you would like us to address you). Second, we ask for a valid reply email address (one that you will actually access and use to communicate further with us).

## How do we use information collected through our sites?

We primarily use personal information you share with us through our sites to communicate directly with you.

If you share personal information with us for our records (for example, online event registration), then we will only use that personal information you share with us for the specific recordkeeping purposes that you shared it with us.

## What information do we share that we collect from our sites?

Whenever you share personal information with us through our sites, we will not share that information with anyone outside of our district leadership without your knowledge and without your explicit permission.

For example, if you register online for one of our events, we will only share that information with relevant district personnel, including qualified volunteers or other persons assisting us with online or onsite registration, for that specific event.

## What if we want to share information collected through our sites with someone else?

Before sharing any personal information you have shared with us through our sites, we will directly seek your permission. First, we will contact you either in person or by email, phone, private message through a common social media platform, or other communication method. We will ask if and how we may share specific personal information that you have shared with us through our sites. Then, only after you have given us your explicit permission will we share any personal information you have shared with us through our sites with anyone outside of district personnel.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the last changes were published, and we offer access to archived versions for your review. If we make any significant changes, we will provide a more prominent notice.
