title: Education and Clergy Development
---

From our earliest days, the Church of the Nazarene has been providing quality education. Today we operate 53 colleges, universities, seminaries, bible colleges, and other institutions of higher education around the world.

The Pittsburgh District has partnered with Eastern Nazarene College in south Boston since 1919.

As a district family, Pittsburgh District Clergy Development also offers locally taught courses through the Pittsburgh District Learning Center and Crossbridge Learning Center. We have courses to help prepare licensed ministers for ordination, and we offer a variety of courses and other learning opportunities for laypersons to become more effective in their ministerial contexts.
