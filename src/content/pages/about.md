title: About Our District
---

The Pittsburgh District Church of the Nazarene has brought together congregations across the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio River Valleys since 1907. We support each other, share resources, and collaborate our local efforts in service to our common mission of discipleship.

## Mount Chestnut Nazarene Center

Forty miles north of Pittsburgh and nestled in the wooded Moraine Valley at the center of our district just outside the city of Butler, Mount Chestnut has served as our administrative home and retreat center since 1967.

Today, Mount Chestnut operates year round and is available for events hosted by our members and for the general public. From week-long camps to client weekends, Mount Chestnut’s rural and peaceful setting is perfect for outings of all sizes.

## _Manual of the Church of the Nazarene_

The _Manual of the Church of the Nazarene_ is our official agreed-upon statement of faith, practice, and polity, shared by Nazarenes worldwide.

It includes a brief historical statement of the church globally; the church Constitution, which defines our Articles of Faith, our understanding of the church, the Covenant of Christian Character for holy living, and principles of organization and government; the Covenant of Christian Conduct, which address key issues of contemporary society; and policies of church government dealing with the local, district, and general church organization.

The 2017–2021 Manual is freely available [online](https://2017.manual.nazarene.org/) and can be purchased from [the Foundry Publishing](https://www.thefoundrypublishing.com/manual.html).

## Education

Education has been a central part of the Church of the Nazarene’s commitment to discipleship making from our earliest beginnings. Today, Nazarenes are blessed with the resources and responsibility of a network of 53 colleges, universities, and seminaries, which provide education to 53,000 students in more than 120 world areas.

Eastern Nazarene CollegeAs a district we’ve shared a special bond with Eastern Nazarene College (ENC) since 1919. Over the years our district has sent hundreds of students and thousands of dollars to Boston’s south shore. And in return ENC has nurtured a world-class liberal arts environment integrating “the best in education and the best in Christian faith.” Many of our finest leaders make their way back to us from ENC. Together the Pittsburgh District and ENC have graduates serving around the world too. On campus and across our district we hold events regularly with ENC to strengthen our partnership—from local concerts, to Celebrate Life, to Family Camp, and more.

Locally, we also sponsor Pittsburgh District Clergy Development and the Pittsburgh District Learning Center, offering individualized instruction at affordable prices for members of the clergy and laypersons alike.

## Global Outreach

We are passionate about making a difference in the world by taking the Good News of Jesus Christ to people everywhere, at home and abroad. The Church of the Nazarene has approximately 700 missionaries and volunteers from around the world serving around the world. At any given moment, Nazarenes can be found worshiping in 162 world areas, in more than 212 languages—with literature produced in 90 of these. Our church operates 33 medical clinics and hospitals worldwide. Made possible by the contributions of the global Nazarene family, including our district since 1907, Nazarenes also engage in starting new local churches by praying, giving, and learning about and from our domestic and foreign missionaries.

## Theology

The Church of the Nazarene is a denomination within the global Christian faith and is rooted in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement.

We believe the Bible is God’s word. These sacred scriptures passed down through generations form a story that reveals a loving God intimately engaging with creation around us. We especially believe that Jesus of Nazareth embodied and exemplifies this same loving Spirit which God shares with us through his life, ministry, execution, and resurrection. And thanks to the abiding presence  of Christ’s Holy Spirit, we sense God calling us to share this same radical love with the whole of creation too.

We believe that God is continuously calling every single person and preparing us to receive grace for the forgiveness of sins and empowering us to extend this same grace to one another.

In particular, we believe this prevenient grace leads to our being made new and living in right relationship with God, all through an experience called sanctification—God transforming us to become more and more like Christ.

Ultimately, we seek to live Spirit-filled lives in Christ and join in God’s mission to make Christlike disciples in the nations, believing that our becoming more like Jesus is wrapped up in assisting others to become more Christlike too.

## Government

Resulting from the mergers of 15 Wesleyan-Holiness groups over the course of the twentieth century, the Church of the Nazarene endeavors to maintain an open and representative government united around the pursuit of holiness.

Six elected representatives serve on the Board of General Superintendents. This board administers the worldwide work of the Church of the Nazarene.

The Board of General Superintendents also interprets the denomination’s book of polity, the Manual of the Church of the Nazarene, which is written and revised every four years by a General Assembly.

Comprising a global network of elected clergy and lay representatives, the General Assembly elects the members of the Board of General Superintendents and considers legislative proposals from the church’s 450-plus districts which are spread across 162 world areas and organized into six world regions. Topics under consideration may range from methods for calling a pastor to taking a particular stance on bioethics.

The General Assembly also elects representatives from around the world to the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene. The General Board carries out the corporate business of the denomination.

The individual districts meet as their own annual district assemblies which are comprised of clergy and lay representatives from that district’s local churches. The district assemblies elect their officers, credential their ministers, and organize collaborative efforts to facilitate the mission of each local church.

It is in the local church that the saving, perfecting, teaching, and commissioning work of the church takes place. The local church, the Body of Christ, is the representation of our faith and mission.

## A Tradition of Service

Following Jesus’ example, Nazarenes around the globe are living compassionately every day. Local churches work to clothe, shelter, feed, heal, educate, and live in solidarity with those who suffer under oppression, injustice, violence, poverty, hunger, and disease.

Nazarene Compassionate Ministries (NCM), an outflow of the Church of the Nazarene, helps to mobilize local congregations to live out Christ’s call to care for those considered the “least of these” (Matthew 25). NCM supports local church efforts to provide tangible expressions of Christ’s compassion through church-led community development and emergency relief efforts. Proclaiming and demonstrating the gospel of Christ transforms lives.

Nazarenes also offer their time and services on volunteer through Work & Witness teams to erect church buildings, schools, and clinics while sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.

The worldwide network of Nazarene churches makes it possible for our denomination to serve as a conduit of assistance to hurting nations. We provide money for food, medical supplies, clothing, and other items to persons in a number of countries where there are pressing needs. In addition, our missionary infrastructure is often commissioned by World Relief and similar agencies when they need assistance in getting supplies to people in remote or troubled areas.
