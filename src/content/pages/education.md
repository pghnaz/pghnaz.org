title: Education and Clergy Development
---

From our earliest days, the Church of the Nazarene has been providing quality education. Today we operate 53 colleges, universities, seminaries, bible colleges, and other institutions of higher education around the world, which provide education to 53,000 students from more than 120 world areas.

As a district we’ve shared a special bond with [Eastern Nazarene College](https://enc.edu/) (<abbr title="Eastern Nazarene College">ENC</abbr>) since 1919. For a century, our district has sent hundreds of students and thousands of dollars to flourish on Boston’s south shore. And in return ENC has nurtured a world-class liberal arts environment integrating “the best in education and the best in Christian faith.” Many of our finest leaders make their way back to us from ENC. Many more are serving God and the church around the world. On campus and across our district we hold events regularly with ENC to strengthen our partnership—from local concerts, to Celebrate Life, to Family Camp, and more.

As a district family, Pittsburgh District Clergy Development also offers locally taught courses through the Pittsburgh District Learning Center and Crossbridge Learning Center. We have courses to help prepare licensed ministers for ordination, and we offer a variety of courses and other learning opportunities for laypersons to become more effective in their ministerial contexts at a price they can afford.
