## About District Assembly

District Assembly is our annual family reunion and business meeting. Every local church is represented. And laypersons and members of the clergy share equal voice. All are welcome!

Each year we celebrate the work God has accomplished among us. We pray together, hear sermons and testimonies by our general superintendent in jurisdiction, elect officers, credential ministers, and plan for the continued success of each of our local churches as we pursue our mission “to make Christlike disciples in the nations.”
