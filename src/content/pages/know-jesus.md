People, both Christians and non-Christians, find ways either to over-complicate or over-simplify what it means to live in faith.

If you’ve found this page, then we want you to know that living faithfully with a knowledge of the presence of Jesus’ Holy Spirit really is quite simple: loving God and loving others like God loves us.

But faith is also complex enough to enrich us for lifetimes: calling and challenging us today to love God and others—including ourselves—more deeply than we thought possible yesterday.

If you don’t already know Jesus in the way we’ve described throughout this website, then here’s how you can start:

## Recognize God preparing you and calling you to this moment.

God loves you.

> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)

And God wants to empower you to live as only God can.

> I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. (John 10:10b)

## Acknowledge the sin—the pain, the denial, the shortcomings, the disobedience—that has kept you from living the life God wants for you.

Everyone of us has sinned.

> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)

Sin ultimately brings death.

> For the wages of sin is death. (Romans 6:23a)

We can’t deal with sin ourselves. As sinners we often try—futilely—to find life’s true meaning in the wrong ways and places. Because we were meant to live with God—not without God—it’s only through God’s loving and gracious presence that we can be saved from the sinful situation in which we find ourselves.

> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. (Ephesians 2:8–9)

## See Jesus’s life, ministry, execution, and resurrection for what they really are.

Two thousand years ago Jesus of Nazareth called the world around him to repent and embrace a life of radical love for one another. The love he talked about and demonstrated was so radical—so self-giving, so disruptive—that the Roman authorities ultimately executed him in an attempt to silence him, even though he had committed no crime.

The way the Bible tells us Jesus handled his trial, imprisonment, and crucifixion, shows how committed Jesus was to this divine agenda of love: he shouldn’t have had to die, but he knew that those who wanted to kill him—whom he loved just the same—would settle for nothing less.

Jesus didn’t die for only some of us. Jesus died for each and every one of us.

> God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)

And death doesn’t have the last word!


God raised Jesus from the dead, and Jesus offers you new life too.

> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Jesus gives you inner peace.

> Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. (Romans 5:1)

Jesus gives you freedom.

> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. (John 8:36)

Jesus gives you eternal life.

> The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23b)

## Answer Jesus’ call to repentance—to change your heart and life.

> Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. (Proverbs 28:13).

To repent you can pray to God and:

1. Confess your sins,
2. Forsake your sins, and
3. Accept God’s life-changing gift made possible through Christ to free you from sin.

God promises to forgive you.

> If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)

## Place your trust in Jesus and receive all that he lovingly offers you

Jesus is always prepared to receive you.

> Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. (Revelation 3:20)
