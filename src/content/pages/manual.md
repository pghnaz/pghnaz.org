The _Manual of the Church of the Nazarene_ is our official agreed-upon statement of faith, practice, and polity, shared by Nazarenes worldwide.

Every four years the General Assembly meets to adopt revisions and additions to the _Manual_. It contains a brief historical statement of the church globally; the church Constitution, which defines our Articles of Faith, our understanding of the church, the Covenant of Christian Character for holy living, and principles of organization and government; the Covenant of Christian Conduct, which address key issues of contemporary society; and policies of church government dealing with the local, district, and general church organization.

The 2017â€“2021 edition of the _Manual_ is freely available [online](http://2017.manual.nazarene.org/). Print copies are available for purchase from [the Foundry Publishing](https://www.thefoundrypublishing.com/manual.html).
