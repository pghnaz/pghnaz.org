## The International Church of the Nazarene

The Pittsburgh District is one of 470 other districts in the International Church of the Nazarene.

Founded in 1908, the Church of the Nazarene as we know it today is the result of 15 mergers between holiness groups desiring to unite under one banner “to make Christlike disciples in the nations.”

The Church of the Nazarene today has established a missional presence in 162 world areas with more than 2.5 million total members among over 29,000 local congregations and growing.

## USA/Canada Region

The International Church of the Nazarene is organized into six world regions. Our USA/Canada region comprises over 5,000 interconnected local churches across 80 districts.  These congregations and districts are led by deeply dedicated Christians who are committed to Jesus Christ and his transformational message of hope and holiness.

The region exists to support and fulfill the mission of the Church of the Nazarene—to make Christlike disciples in the nations.  To this end, leaders of the region have mutually agreed on Five Strategic Priorities.

1. **Intentional Leadership Development**—Recognize, develop, train and release passionate leaders with a Wesleyan-Arminian focus.
2. **Vibrant Church Renewal**—Help each local church discover new missional life.
3. **Clear and Coherent Theological Identity**—Facilitate communication and collaboration between the Global Ministry Center, educational fields, educational institutions, ministers and laity through print, electronic media, civil conversation, and clear preaching.
4. **Passionate Missional Outreach**—Release and encourage our people to embrace with open arms and hearts both the needy and the new people groups among us.
5. **Multi-faceted New Church Development**—Foster an environment and enthusiasm for starting new churches through districts and local churches.
