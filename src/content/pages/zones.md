title: District Zones
layout: zones

Weâ€™ve organized our district into twelve zones.

* Zones help us build a sense of community and camaraderie among the pastors and local churches of that zone.
* Zones help us promote the cause of Christ by encouraging and strategizing for ministerial development, church growth, evangelism, starting and restarting churches.
* Zones serve as a communications bridge between the local congregations and the district.
* Our zone coordinators carry out specific assignments on behalf of the [district superintendent](/officers/) and the [District Advisory Board](/boards-and-committes/).

Check out our [Church Directory](/directory/) or our interactive [District Map](/map/) for a full list of local churches.

Please pray with us for each of our local churches, especially those [seeking their next pastor](/open-churches/).
