As a district family, we’ve shared a special bond with [Eastern Nazarene College (<abbr title="Eastern Nazarene College">ENC</abbr>)](https://enc.edu/) since 1919.

Over the years our district has sent hundreds of students and thousands of dollars in funding to Boston’s south shore.

In return ENC has nurtured a world-class liberal arts environment integrating “the best in education and the best in Christian faith.”

Many of our finest leaders make their way back to us from ENC. Together the Pittsburgh District and ENC have graduates serving around the world too.

On campus and across our district we hold events regularly with ENC to strengthen our partnership—from local concerts, to Festival of Life, to camps, and more.
