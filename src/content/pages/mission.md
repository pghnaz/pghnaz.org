The mission of the International Church of the Nazarene is [“to make Christlike disciples in the nations.”](http://nazarene.org/mission/)

These seven words combine two of Jesus of Nazareth’s most basic teachings.

In Matthew 28:19–20 Jesus instructs us to “go and make disciples of all nations” (often called the Great Commission).

Similarly, in Matthew 22:37–40 and throughout the gospels, Jesus reminds us God’s command in Deuteronomy 6:5 to “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind’ and to ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’” (often called the Great Commandment).

As a district, we embrace our mission

> to fulfill the Great Commission and the Great Commandment. We will be a “sent” people—strengthening local churches, developing clergy and lay leadership, building community, and being missional as we establish dynamic churches and ministries—who will bring glory to God and the transforming message of holy love to people in Western Pennsylvania.
